The principal parts of the double bottom are the flat keel, vertical keel, floors, intercostal girders, bilge, brackets, tank top, longitudinals, bounding bars and angle clips. 

Frames in the void wing tank of a river barge. In this photo, the knuckle plate has been cut away so that bent frames can be renewed. The double bottom is exposed. New knuckle plate will be installed once the frames are renewed. 
The USCG inspects all phases of tank barge repair and construction. This wing tank will be pressurized with air and each seam will be sprayed with a soap mixture to check for the smallest of leaks. The hulls of tank barges are literally air tight.

									<h3>Knuckle Plate </h3></p>A plate bent to form a knuckle. A knuckle is a rounded corner usually found on the bottom of a vessel. It is believed that if a vessel contacts the river bank, a vessel with rounded 
'knuckle' plates can be dislodged easier than one that has sharp corners. 
Knuckle plates. These plates have been shaped to the exact radius needed for the vessel. They have been sandblasted and coated on the inside to stop corrosion inside the vessel. 
<li>
									<h3>Kort Nozzles </h3></p>A steel tube that surrounds a propeller, directing the water and improving efficiency. 
Kort nozzles are engineered to improve the flow around the propellers. They are similar in some ways to an airplane propeller. The propeller shaft on this vessel is being 'pulled'. Propulsion systems on vessels are inspected and worn parts are replaced at each drydock opportunity. </p>

It should be remembered that this moulded surface is not an actual part of the ship. It is almost exactly the shape which a thin piece of sheet rubber would take if stretched tightly over the shell frames and main deck beams with no plating in place.

<li>

								</li>   
<li>
									<h3>Tow Knee </h3>
									<p>On a tow boat (so named because they push a bunch of barges called a 'tow') there are almost always 2 vertical supports for the barges to rest on. These are called tow knees and they have stairs built in for the crew to get to the barges.</p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Tractor Propulsion </h3>
									<p>A system of vertical blades used to propel a vessel in the water. Used on some harbor tugs and ferries. Made by Volith. Sometimes called a cyclonic system in 

reference to the way the blades are mounted under the hull, and the way they turn. </p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Transom </h3>
									<p>The main frame at the rudder stock 
(cant frames usually radiate from the transom frame). The very last (most aft) plate on a welded vessel. </p>

<li>
									<h3>Transverse </h3>
									<p>Athwartships; at right angles to the keel. </p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Transverse Frames </h3>
									<p>Athwartship members forming the ship's "ribs." Also see Buck frame. These are the ribs or frames of the ship, and when placed in position, give the principal shape or contour, Transverses are not all the same distance apart; amidships, where there is the greatest strain, they are spaced more closely. 
The transverses are cut or notched where they connect on the shell, to allow the longitudinals to pass through. They are strengthened by clips at these points. </p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Travelift (TM) </h3>
									<p>A device for lifting vessels out of the water. Has rubber tires and slings. The slings are lowered in the water, the vessel is floated in and lifted out of the water with cable winches. Once raised, the vessel can be moved to a station, blocked, etc. and the Travelift can return to the slip to move another vessel. </p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Trim </h3>
									<p>To shift ballast; to cause a ship to 
change its position in the water; drag. </p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Trunk </h3>
									<p>A small casing passing through a deck, such as is used for ladders or ventilation. </p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Tug Boat </h3>
									<p>A relatively small vessel with a big engine used to 1/ assist ships when the ships are being docked 2/ tow barges by pulling them with a cable in the ocean 3/</p>
								</li>  
<li>
									<h3>Tumble Home </h3>
									<p>An inboard slant of a ship's side above the bilge. The amount the top of the side shell slopes back toward the centerline between the point of widest breadth and the deck at side.  </p>

									<h3>Water Line</h3>
									<p>Any one of certain lines of a ship parallel with (and at various heights above) the base line. In half-breadth plans the waterlines are smooth curves showing the shape 
of the ship; in profile plans they a re projected as straight lines </p><p>
The intersection of the moulded surface with a horizontal plane at a given height above the base line. The six foot water line is exactly six feet higher than the base line. </p><p>
These intersections are shown in the half breadth plan in the lines drawing. They should not be confused with the "load line" marked on the outside of a ship when built. Ship fitters use a waterline merely as a height above the base line and in this sense waterlines are marked on bulkheads, frames, and other members, for the purpose of properly setting and aligning the structure.
